# Android-Decompiler

I Made is project Inspired by http://www.javadecompilers.com/ to help people's easily Decompile/Reverse Engineer a android apk file.
Initially intented to be a web site for which i did get a domain (androiddecompilers.com).

As decompiling is a resource intensive process after having it running for about 4 month was unable to keep-up with the server cost. so i shut down the website. the code was laying in my computer collecting dust for about 8 month.

After some thought i choose to make it an open source project.
